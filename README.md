## üìù Introduction
IdASM is a **custom assembler** designed to write programs that run on the **Id16bit** virtual CPU.  
It is intended to:
- provide a simple introduction to assembly programming,
- be used for experimentation (emulation, compiler design, reverse engineering).
- have fun

> ‚ö†Ô∏è I didn't have any prior experience in creating programing languages when I created IdASM. \
> I learned a lot while doing it and would do things differently now, specially in regard of the lexing / parsing. \
> So use it as you like, have fun, but be critical towards the implementation üëå

## üî§ Syntax

### General Structure
An IdASM file consists of **functions** containing **instructions** and **controls**.

‚ö†Ô∏è The program entry point depends on the way it is fed to the Id16bit,
but it's usually at the first instruction of the first function, no matter how it's named. 

A function must be declared with the keyword **func** then with the function name:
```idasm
func myAwesomeFunction {}
```

Each instruction follows this format:

- `INSTRUCTION`: the instruction keyword (e.g., `MOVE`, `ADD`, `MUL`)
- `PARAMETER`: can be a register, a numeric literal, a label, etc.

Instructions expect between 0 and 2 parameters, depending on which one.

### Values

There is 2 main value types:
- `immediate value`
- `memory address`

each with their subtypes:

`immediate value` types:
- `int` - represents a direct value, can be written in 3 bases:
    - `0` - decimal
    - `0x0` - hexadecimal
    - `0b0` - binary
- `char` - represents a char, but is really an int under the hood.
    - Written as follows: `'a'`
- `string` - represents a string, only accepted by the `PRINT` instruction as of now.
    - Written as follows: `"Hello World !\n"`

`memory address` types:
- `static address` - represents one of the known addresses of the `Id16Bit` CPU.
  - if used as a source, will give it's content as value
  - if used as a destination, will store the value
  - ex: `R0`
  - (see [CPU static addresses](#cpu-static-addresses))
- `pointer` - a pointer will the use the value stored inside the provided memory address
    - Written as follows: `*<memory_address>` ex: `*R0`
- `mem location` - represents a place in RAM.
    - Written as follows: `[<memory_address | immediate_value>]`
  
---

### Instructions
Here is the list of **reserved instructions**:

Data:
- `MOVE SRC<any> DEST<memory_address>` ‚Äì copy a value into a different memory place
- `PUSH SRC<any>` ‚Äì push a value to the stack
- `POP DEST<memory_address>` ‚Äì pop a value to the stack and store it where specified
- `RET VALUE<any>?` - return from a function and push it's return value to the stack, if any

Math: (result go to register `ACC0`)
- `ADD PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì add two values
- `SUB PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì subtract `PARAM1` to `PARAM0`
- `DIV PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì divide `PARAM0` by `PARAM1`
- `MOD PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì modulo `PARAM0` by `PARAM1`
- `MUL PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì multiply `PARAM0` by `PARAM1`
- `INCR PARAM0<any>` ‚Äì increment `PARAM0` by 1
- `DECR PARAM0<any>` ‚Äì decrement `PARAM0` by 1

Bitwise:
- `AND PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì and `PARAM1` & `PARAM0`
- `OR PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì or `PARAM1` | `PARAM0`
- `XOR PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì xor `PARAM1` ^ `PARAM0`
- `LSHFT PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì left shift `PARAM0` bits of `PARAM1` place
- `RSHFT PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì right shift `PARAM0` bits of `PARAM1` place

Control: (all `JMPX` instructions will jump to the address stored in `R3` if their condition is met)
- `JMPL PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì jump if `PARAM0` `<` `PARAM1`
- `JMPLE PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì jump if `PARAM0` `<=` `PARAM1`
- `JMPE PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì jump if `PARAM0` `==` `PARAM1`
- `JMPG PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì jump if `PARAM0` `>=` `PARAM1`
- `JMPGE PARAM0<any> PARAM1<any>` ‚Äì jump if `PARAM0` `>` `PARAM1`
- `GOTO PARAM0<any>` ‚Äì unconditional jump to the `PARAM0` address
- `INTR PARAM0<any>` ‚Äì trigger an interrupt with the code in `PARAM0`

IO:
- `PRINT PARAM0<any>` - print the value of `PARAM0` to `STDOUT`
- `GETC PARAM0<memory_address>` - read a char from `STDIN` and store it inside `PARAM0`.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è note it's non-blocking and that if there is no input to be read, `PARAM0` will be equal to `0`
- `BGETC PARAM0<memory_address>` - wait until there is an input to read from `STDIN` and store it inside `PARAM0`.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è note it's blocking and will wait until there is an input to read

### Controls

You can do some simplified logic controls with `loop` and `if`.
Both have the same structure:
```
<loop | if> <value> <cmp_operator> <value> {
    # instructions
}
```

Example:
```idasm
# list of all cmp operators:
# < | <= | == | >= | >

MOVE 0 R0

loop R0 < 3 {

    MOD R0 2
    
    if ACC0 == 0 {
        ADD R0 48
    
        PRINT "even: "
        PRINT ACC0
        PRINT '\n'
    }
    
    INCR R0
}
```

### Comments
Comments begin with `#` and extend to the end of the line:

```idasm
# This is a comment
MOVE 10 R1 # Move 10 into register R1
```
---

### CPU static addresses
The Id16bit CPU provides the following **registers**:

- `R0 / R1 / R2` ‚Äì general purpose registers
- `R3` ‚Äì it's value is read by `JMPX` instructions if their condition is met
- `ACC0` ‚Äì the result of math computation
- `ACC1` ‚Äì the secondary result of math computation (ex: remainder in division)
- `SPTR` ‚Äì stack pointer
- `EXPTR` ‚Äì instruction pointer
- `STACK` - the stack.
  - if used as a source, will decrement `SPTR`
  - if used as a destination, will increment `SPTR`
- `FLAGS` ‚Äì flags are set based on last math computation result
- `MEMEXT` - is used to increase memory addressing from 16 to 32 bits, are the 16 high bits
- `INTRC` - store the interrupt code,
- `IN` - the computer input
- `OUT` - the computer output

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compiler Options
The **IdASM** compiler supports several options:

- `-o=<output_file_name>` ‚Äì output file name

It outputs a xmem file, that can itself be compiled using the [XMem compiler](https://github.com/IdCom4/Xmem-compiler) to the final binary file
